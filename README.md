# Date
java class Date processes dates in the string format 00/00/0000 from 01/01/1800 to 12/31/2500.  
Date converts the string date into an int vlaue i days from day 0, 01/01/1800.  
It then can subtract two dates and return the number of days between them 
Increment a date by a number of days
Compare two dates using equals and compareTo 
Return a string representation of the days integer value in the correct date format 


I would like to add a decrement function as well
also need to put in lots of comments
